My name is Paul W. Rankin. I'm a writer and filmmaker currently in
Brisbane, Australia.

## Current Projects

### [By Dasein]

Boutique video production company, specialising in the arts sector.

### Quiet on Earth

A wordless film in which a man treks across a barren desert world in
search of a missing woman. He has a rifle and a map. He has seven
bullets. He has been stabbed. Someone is following him.

### The Abductors

In the depths of the Honduran jungle, an alcoholic foreign-aid doctor
who has lost everything must lead a village of Miskito natives in a
fight against child-snatching goblins.

### [Fountain Mode]

The open source scriptwriting program for the GNU Emacs platform, using
the plain-text [Fountain] markup language.
